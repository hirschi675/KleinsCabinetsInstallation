# KleinsCabinetsInstallation

This is a project that I started for my uncle I wanted to make a website for him, and his company.  They install cabinets and I thought I could make a website so he could find customers more easily. This is one of the  first websites I've made, and it was a lot of fun to try and develop this.  I liked all the features that are added like the store and the photo gallery.
